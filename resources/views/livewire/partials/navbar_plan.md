### Plan to Address Header Dropdown Issue

1. **Check JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Ensure that the necessary JavaScript libraries or scripts for handling dropdown functionality are included in the project.
   - Verify that the script responsible for toggling the dropdown is correctly linked and functioning.

2. **Inspect CSS Classes**:
   - Review the CSS classes applied to the dropdown menu to ensure they are correctly set to show/hide the dropdown.
   - Check for any conflicting styles that may prevent the dropdown from displaying.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - Confirm that the event listeners for the dropdown toggle button are correctly set up to handle click events.
   - Ensure that the dropdown menu is being shown or hidden based on the button's state.

4. **Testing**:
   - After making any necessary adjustments, test the dropdown functionality to ensure it works as expected.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes made to the JavaScript and CSS.
- Test the dropdown functionality in different scenarios (e.g., logged in vs. logged out).
